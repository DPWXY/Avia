        "prompt": "Pilot: Engine failure—do I need to notify anyone if the engine restarts?",
        "completion": "LLM: Yes. Even if the engine restarts, inform ATC of your situation. Advise them that you experienced an engine failure and are proceeding to the nearest airport as a precaution."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: I'm about to declare an emergency. What exact phrase should I use?",
        "completion": "LLM: When declaring an emergency, state clearly: “Mayday, mayday, [who] [where] emergency landing [# of passengers].” Be sure to activate your ELT and set your transponder to 7700 before making the call."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Wing fire—how do I ensure the fuel stays away from the fire?",
        "completion": "LLM: To keep the fuel away from the fire, immediately turn the selector to the side not affected by the fire and perform a sideslip. This maneuver helps direct the fuel away from the critical areas."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Engine fire on the ground—how do I safely shut down the engine if it restarts?",
        "completion": "LLM: If the engine restarts, maintain about 1800 RPM for a few minutes to confirm stability. Then shut down the engine and inspect for any damage before continuing with the fire suppression and evacuation procedures."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: There's a cabin fire and I'm unsure if I should reopen vents immediately after extinguishing it. What do I do?",
        "completion": "LLM: After completely extinguishing the cabin fire, wait until you're sure the fire is fully out. Then reopen the vents, cabin heat, and cabin air, and proceed with preparing for a precautionary landing."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Engine failure—how do I manage the transition from attempting a restart to declaring an emergency?",
        "completion": "LLM: Once you've completed the checklist (selector, shutoff, throttle, mixture, fuel pump, crank, and magnetos) and the engine still won't restart, immediately declare an emergency by activating the ELT, setting the transponder to 7700, and contacting ATC with the appropriate mayday call."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: I'm having trouble maintaining the proper airspeed during an emergency landing without power. Any advice?",
        "completion": "LLM: Keep a close eye on your airspeed indicator. Aim for 65 knots if using flaps or 70 knots without. Adjust your pitch and use minor control inputs to maintain that speed as you configure for landing."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Engine fire in flight—do I need to adjust the throttle after setting the mixture to idle?",
        "completion": "LLM: No, once you set the mixture to idle and move the engine shutoff out to cut fuel, maintain your current airspeed under 160 knots while you prepare for your emergency landing."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: During a precautionary landing with power, how should I manage my flaps between the field and final?",
        "completion": "LLM: Start with 20° flaps while flying over your chosen field at about 65 knots. Then, on final, deploy full flaps if conditions allow. This helps stabilize your approach and slow your airspeed effectively."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: I'm not sure I followed the fuel pump procedure correctly during engine failure. Can you repeat that step?",
        "completion": "LLM: Sure. After leaning the mixture, turn the fuel pump on briefly and then off before attempting to crank the engine again. This sequence helps address any fuel delivery issues."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Electrical fire—if I detect a smell when turning systems back on, what should I do?",
        "completion": "LLM: If you notice an unusual smell while testing the standby battery, master, or avionics, shut the system off immediately and do not attempt to power it on again. Land at the nearest airport and have maintenance inspect the system."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: I'm on final for an emergency landing without power. Confirm my actions: full flaps, mixture idle, doors unlatch, then heavy braking?",
        "completion": "LLM: Correct. On final, deploy full flaps (if possible), set the mixture to idle, turn off standby and master, disable magnetos, unlatch the doors, and upon touchdown, apply heavy braking."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: There's a wing fire. Should I immediately adjust the selector or first turn off the lights?",
        "completion": "LLM: Immediately turn off all external lights and pitot heat, then adjust the selector to the side away from the fire. This sequence minimizes additional heat and directs fuel away from the affected area."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Engine failure—how do I know if the enriched mixture is working?",
        "completion": "LLM: When you crank the engine with the enriched mixture, listen and watch for any sign of improved engine performance. If the engine starts or shows signs of responsiveness, that indicates the enriched mixture is having a positive effect."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: I'm not clear on the radio procedure after a failed engine restart. Can you repeat it?",
        "completion": "LLM: Certainly. If the engine fails to restart, declare an emergency by activating the ELT, setting the transponder to 7700, and pressing and holding the radio switch to set COM to 121.5. Then clearly state: “Mayday, mayday, [who] [where] emergency landing [# of passengers].”"
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Engine fire on ground—what if I can't get the engine to maintain 1800 RPM?",
        "completion": "LLM: If the engine won't maintain 1800 RPM, do not delay shutting it down. Proceed to immediately turn off the engine, then follow the checklist for extinguishing the fire and evacuating passengers."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: During an engine failure, how do I know if I should switch from trying to restart to declaring an emergency?",
        "completion": "LLM: If you've completed all steps of the engine checklist (selector, shutoff, throttle, mixture, fuel pump, crank, and magnetos) and there's still no restart, then it's time to declare an emergency without further delay."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Wing fire detected—how do I know if my sideslip is effective?",
        "completion": "LLM: An effective sideslip will cause the fire to visibly shift away from the fuel tank and cabin. Monitor your airspeed to ensure you remain below 160 knots while executing the maneuver."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: I'm preparing for a precautionary landing with power. Should I monitor my airspeed closely?",
        "completion": "LLM: Absolutely. Maintain an airspeed of about 65 knots while using flaps and 70 knots without. Constant monitoring is key to a smooth landing approach."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: After extinguishing an electrical fire, what's my next immediate action?",
        "completion": "LLM: Once the electrical fire is out and systems have been cautiously reactivated, immediately prepare to land at the nearest airport while keeping a close watch on all systems for any further anomalies."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Engine failure—should I adjust my flaps before or after declaring an emergency?",
        "completion": "LLM: First, attempt the engine checklist with flaps set for best glide. If the engine still won't restart, then declare an emergency and continue with the landing configuration as outlined in your emergency checklist."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: I'm about to contact ATC after an engine failure. What details should I include?",
        "completion": "LLM: Include your situation (engine failure), your current position, altitude, and the number of passengers onboard. For example: “Mayday, mayday, engine failure at [location], altitude [x], [number] of passengers, emergency landing requested.”"
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Precautionary landing with power—do I need to adjust the master switch on final?",
        "completion": "LLM: Yes. On final for a precautionary landing with power, after deploying full flaps, turn off the standby and master switches, and disable the magnetos before touchdown."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Engine failure—should I lean the mixture before or after checking the fuel pump?",
        "completion": "LLM: After trimming for best glide, set the throttle to one-quarter power and then lean the mixture. Once that's done, toggle the fuel pump on briefly then off before attempting an engine restart."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: I need to repeat the engine failure checklist slowly. Can you walk me through it step-by-step?",
        "completion": "LLM: Certainly. First, trim the nose up twice to reach 68 knots. Next, look outside for a large, flat, yellow field free of obstacles. Then, cycle through the engine checklist: move the selector left, right, and both; shift the shutoff to in; set the throttle to ¼; lean the mixture; turn the fuel pump on briefly then off; crank the engine with enriched mixture; and finally, test the magnetos by switching left, right, then both. If the engine restarts, proceed to land at the nearest airport; if not, declare an emergency."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Engine fire in flight—do I need to change my approach if I can't deploy flaps?",
        "completion": "LLM: If you're unable to deploy flaps, maintain a controlled airspeed below 160 knots and prepare for an engine-out landing. Focus on keeping the aircraft stable and follow the rest of the emergency checklist."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: There's a cabin fire. Should I shut off the engine immediately?",
        "completion": "LLM: For a cabin fire, first shut off the standby battery and master switch, then disable vents, cabin heat, and cabin air before activating the fire extinguisher. Only after the fire is fully out do you proceed with landing procedures."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Electrical fire—if I can't determine which switch is causing the issue, what's my best move?",
        "completion": "LLM: In that case, shut down all systems by turning off the standby battery, master switch, and all avionics. Then, use your fire extinguisher on any visible flames. After confirming the fire is out, cautiously attempt to power systems one by one, and plan to land at the nearest airport."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: I'm having issues with the magnetos during engine failure. Should I try both simultaneously?",
        "completion": "LLM: No, cycle them individually: first try left, then right, then both. This method helps isolate any issues with a single magneto before you decide to declare an emergency."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Engine failure—how critical is it to adjust the throttle exactly to ¼ power?",
        "completion": "LLM: It's important to set the throttle around ¼ power during your checklist. This helps determine if a brief power boost can aid in restarting the engine without causing further damage."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: I'm executing an emergency landing without power. Confirm: secure seats, 65 knots with flaps, full flaps on final, mixture idle, standby/master/magnetos off, doors unlatch, heavy braking.",
        "completion": "LLM: That's correct. Follow that sequence meticulously to ensure a controlled landing."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: During an engine fire, when should I open the doors?",
        "completion": "LLM: Open the doors before landing, after you've secured the aircraft and set your approach. This ensures a swift evacuation if needed upon touchdown."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Wing fire—do I need to change my radio frequency?",
        "completion": "LLM: No, focus on extinguishing the fire and executing a sideslip. Continue monitoring your systems and prepare for a precautionary landing with power."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: Engine failure checklist—do I need to adjust the mixture again if the engine begins to sputter?",
        "completion": "LLM: Yes, if the engine begins to sputter during your restart attempt, enrich the mixture slightly while cranking again. Monitor for any signs of recovery and adjust accordingly."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Pilot: I'm having trouble with the fuel pump step in the engine failure checklist. Can you repeat it?",
        "completion": "LLM: Of course. After leaning the mixture, turn the fuel pump on briefly, then turn it off before you crank the engine again with the enriched mixture."
