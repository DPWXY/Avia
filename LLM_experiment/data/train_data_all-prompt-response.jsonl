In an engine failure, trim to 68 knots, select a safe field, and run through the checklist. For engine or wing fires, cut fuel by idling the mixture and shutting off systems, then execute a sideslip or appropriate landing procedure. For electrical or cabin fires, shut down power, extinguish the fire, then prepare for landing. Always be ready to declare an emergency if the engine does not restart."}]}
